30.10.2025 start of coding, my mini projects

08.11.2025 I do Telegram Bot that allows you to post anything on your Facebook Page, it requires os, requests, functools, telegram(update), telegram.ext(ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, filters, ContextTypes)
For using this bot you need to create a app in graph api, after creating app you will need to get your page access token with permissions - pages_read_engagemen, pages_manage_posts as admin, this scrypt takes the text/photo and upload it right in your FB Page
